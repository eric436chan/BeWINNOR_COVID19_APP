    <string name="the_risk_calculator">About the Risk Calculator</string>
    <string name="the_risk_calculator_description">The current risk-score calculation was developed using information on the risk for COVID-19 mortality associated with age, gender, race, social deprivation and 12 different health conditions published in a recent large UK study. The risk score was adopted to US setting by information on mortality rate by age and various race/ethnicity groups published by the Center for Disease Control. Further relative risks for individuals are provided by standardization with respect to average risk for the US population, calculated using available information on prevalence and co-occurrence of various risk-factors available form national databases.</string>
